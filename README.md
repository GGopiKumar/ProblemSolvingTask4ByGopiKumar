Program : 1)Create a Python Class called Circle with Constructor which will take a 
List as an argument for the task. The List is [10, 501, 22, 37, 100, 999, 87, 351)
2)Create proper member variables inside the task if required and use them when necessary. 
For example for this task create a class private variable named pl = 3.141
3)From the given List create two class Methods Area and Perimeter which will be going to calculate the Area and Perimeter.

Logic : Here i have created a class name circle which contain one private variable , Constructor , 2 Class method to calculate 
the area and permiter of the area and using for loop i have created object for the given list in the main function
